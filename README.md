# Synonym or Antonym?

This is a game that expands one's knowledge of vocabulary through having one guess whether a word is a synonym or an antonym of another.

## Instructions

You need Python to play this game.
```console
cd 'DOMAIN WHERE THE GAME WAS DOWNLOADED'
python game.py
```

## Changelog

V1 - Initially built as a text-based game with Python.

## Resources Utilized

This game was made possible by the [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/).

The initial list of words was provided by the [API itself](https://github.com/meetDeveloper/freeDictionaryAPI/blob/master/meta/wordList/english.txt) and [dwyl's english-words repository](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt), which were processed to reduce loading time using the [generate_list.py file](https://github.com/augene/synonym-or-antonym/blob/main/generate_list.py).

## License

Synonym or Antonym? is licensed under the [GNU GPLv3](https://github.com/augene/synonym-or-antonym/blob/main/LICENSE).

## Future Development Plans

I hope to create a website version and an Android app for the game in the future as I learn more about programming.
